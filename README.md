# Angry Regular Guy

Videogame developed in Godot engine, using GDScript as scripting language. 

As this is discontinued for now, I pushed game code to Github for learning purposes. As this is under GPLv3, if you make use of the included sources, you'll need to
make your codebase free/open as well. 

Keys:
- W: Up
- S: Down
- A: Left
- D: Right
- Space: Kick
